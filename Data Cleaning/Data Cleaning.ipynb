    "#### Why Data Cleaning is Important\n",
    "Without properly cleaned data, the results of any data analysis or machine learning model could be inaccurate. It is a commonly known fact that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning, manipulating and transforming data into the shape they want in order to carry out accurate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some common problems with data:\n",
    "- Column headers are variables, not variable names\n",
    "- Multiple variables are stored in one column\n",
    "- Variables are stored in both rows and columns\n",
    "- Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table\n",
    "- A single observational unit stored in multiple tables\n",
