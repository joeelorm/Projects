    "<p style = 'font-family:verdana'>The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to help estimate or predict the credit worthiness of loan applicants. The estimation/prediction will be done by looking at some information (features) on each applicant. This is a case of supervised machine learning technique called classification, where the algorithm is first trained on features of each applicant, and used to classify new applicants as 'worthy' or 'not worthy' for a loan.</p>"

    "<p style = 'font-family:verdana'>In recent times, most industries are on the path of digital transformation and machine learning is at the center of this revolution. Institutions like banks, loan companies, e-commerce companies and hospitals usually employ machine learning to make their work easier. Of all the industries on the path of digital transformation, financial institutions, like loan companies and banks are at the top of the list of those that can benefit the most. Loan companies for example use machine learning which helps them become more agile, and also gives them the ability to process loans faster and more accurately. \n",
